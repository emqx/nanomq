# MQTT STREAM
MQTT messages for the same topic can be viewed as a data stream, and this data stream can be stored and queried. For some poor network environment, it provides a solution for the integrity and reliability of data.

In this chapter, we will focus on [how to enable MQTT streams through configuration files](./configuration.md) and [how to use Consumers to query persistent data](./consumer.md).

## Enable the MQTT STREAM through the configuration file
In this section, we will describe how to enable MQTT streams by configuring the nanomq.conf configuration file.

## Try using a consumer to query persisted data
In this section, we'll show you how to use a consumer to query persistent data, and we'll show you a demo.
