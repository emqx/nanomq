# Enable the MQTT STREAM through the configuration file
In this section, we will describe how to enable MQTT streams by configuring the nanomq.conf configuration file.

## Configuration
Here is a simple example MQTT STREAM configuration.
```
exchange_client.mq1 {
	# # exchanges contains multiple MQ exchanger
	exchange {
		# # MQTT Topic for filtering messages and saving to queue
		topic = "exchange/topic1",
		# # MQ name
		name = "exchange_no1",
		# # MQ category. Only support Ringbus for now
		ringbus = {
			# # ring buffer name
			name = "ringbus",
			# # max length of ring buffer (msg count)
			cap = 1000
			fullOp = 3
		}
	}
}
```

- exchange_client: The client hosting the exchange.
- exchange: It is used to receive a specific topic message and put the message data into ringbus.
- ringbus: For storing mqtt messages, its capacity can be set, and it also provides fullOp, which is the behavior when the ringbus is full.
  - cap: ringbus capacity size.
  - fullOp: Four behaviors are currently provided when the ringbus is full.
    ```
        0: RB_FULL_NONE: When the ringbus is full, no action is taken and the message enqueue fail.
        1: RB_FULL_DROP: When the ringbus is full, the data in the ringbus is discarded.
        2: RB_FULL_RETURN: When the ringbus is full, the data in the ringbus is taken out and returned to the aio.
        3: RB_FULL_FILE(Relying on parquet): When the ringbus is full, the data in the ringbus is written to the file.
    ```
    Note: If fullOp=3 you need to enable PARQUET compilation and configure parquet in nanomq.conf.
    ```
    # Enable PARQUET compile options
    cmake -DENABLE_PARQUET=ON ../
    ```
    ```
    # Configure parquet in nanomq.conf
    parquet {
        compress = gzip
        encryption {
            key_id = kf
            key = "0123456789012345"
            type = AES_GCM_CTR_V1
        }
        dir = "/tmp/nanomq-parquet"
        file_name_prefix = "nanomq-parquet-"
        file_count = 5
    }
    ```

## Testing the MQTT STREAM
This is followed by an example of fullOp of 3 for ringbus to test the offloading capability of mqtt stream. (Remember to enable parquet compile).
1. Configuration
```
...
exchange_client.mq1 {
	# # exchanges contains multiple MQ exchanger
	exchange {
		# # MQTT Topic for filtering messages and saving to queue
		topic = "topic1",
		# # MQ name
		name = "exchange_no1",
		# # MQ category. Only support Ringbus for now
		ringbus = {
			# # ring buffer name
			name = "ringbus",
			# # max length of ring buffer (msg count)
			cap = 10000
			fullOp = 3
		}
	}
}
...
parquet {
    compress = gzip
    encryption {
        key_id = kf
        key = "0123456789012345"
        type = AES_GCM_CTR_V1
    }
    dir = "/tmp/nanomq-parquet"
    file_name_prefix = "nanomq-parquet-"
    file_count = 5
}
...
```

1. Start NanoMQ
```
nanomq start --conf=/etc/nanomq.conf
```

1. Publish mqtt messages
mqtt messages are sent using emqtt_bench
```
emqtt_bench pub -p 1883 -i 1 -I 1 -c 1 -s 10 -t "topic1" -V 5 -L 30005
```

1. The NanoMQ log
NanoMQ prints a log to indicate that the disk write was successful.
```
ringbuffer_parquet_cb: ringbus: parquet write to file: /tmp/nanomq-parquet/nanomq-parquet--79060194635079892~370618470429406089.parquet success
ringbuffer_parquet_cb: ringbus: parquet write to file: /tmp/nanomq-parquet/nanomq-parquet--370618474724373386~375711962341231626.parquet success

```

1. File storage path
```
/tmp/nanomq-parquet/nanomq-parquet--370618474724373386~375711962341231626.parquet
/tmp/nanomq-parquet/nanomq-parquet--375711966636198923~380805454253057163.parquet
