# Configure with WebHook

NanoMQ is equipped with an event-driven WebHook interface, this section introduces how to enable the WebHook interface, relevant configuration items, and how WebHook is triggered by topics or events.

The webhook configuration file is located in `etc/nanomq.conf`, NanoMQ offers 2 formats of configuration files:

- [HOCON (recommended, supported since v0.14 or above)](../config-description/v019.md)
- [Key-Value format](../config-description/v013.md)

## Configure in HOCON

### Enable Webhook

```bash
webhook {
    ......
}
```
**ðŸ“¢ Attention:** for NanoMQ 0-14 ~ 0.18 users, you also need to activate this feature with the `webhook.enable = true` configuration item. For details, see [Configuration v0.14](../config-description/v014.md)

Starting from NanoMQ version 0.18, the `enable` option has been removed. Therefore, to enable the `webhook` configuration, simply add this module to the configuration file as shown above.

### Rule Syntax

NanoMQ provides the following configuration keys for WebHook:

- `event`: string, taking a fixed value
- `topic`: a string, functioning like a topic filter, the messaging forwarding action will only be triggered if the message topic matches the one specified in the rule. 

**Syntax**

```bash
webhook.events = [
    ## Multi rules can be added here.
    {
        <Rule>
    }
]
```

**Example**

For example, you want to forward messages matching the topics of `a/b/c` and `foo/#` to the web server, and the configuration should be:

```bash
webhook.events = [
	{ 
		event = "on_message_publish"
		topic = "a/b/c"
	}
	{
		event = "on_message_publish"
		topic = "foo/#"
	}
]
```

### WebHook Trigger Events

WebHook can be triggered by the following events:

| Name                   | Description                  | **Execution timing**                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| on_client_connack      | Issue connection acknowledge | When the server is ready to send connack packet    |
| on_client_disconnected | disconnected                 | When the client connection layer is about to close |
| on_message_publish     | message published            | Before the broker publishes (routes) the message   |

### Event Parameters

When an event occurs, the NanoMQ WebHook interface will package that event into an HTTP request. This request is then sent to a web server, the location of which is determined by a pre-configured URL. 

The request format is:

```bash
URL: <url>      # From the url field in the configuration file
Method: POST    # Fixed as POST method

Body: <JSON>    # Body is a JSON format string
```

The `body` for different events may differ. The following tables list the body parameters supported in each type of event:

**on_client_connack**

| Key       | Type    | Description                                                  |

| from_client_id | string  | Publisher's Client ID                                        |

### Configure Multiple Rules

NanoMQ supports defining multiple trigger rules through the configuration file. This section will demonstrate by defining two WebHook trigger rules as an example:

- Rule 1: When a message is sent to the "a/b/c" topic, trigger the WebHook. 
- Rule 2: When a client initiates a connection request, trigger the WebHook.

The sample configuration is as follows:

```bash
webhook.events = [
	url = "http://127.0.0.1:80"
	headers.content-type = "application/json"
	body.encoding = plain
	pool_size = 32

	{ 
		event = "on_message_publish"
		topic = "a/b/c"
	}
	{
		event = "on_client_connack"
	}
]
```

where,

`event`: WebHook triggered event, string, supported events include:

- `on_client_connack`: Client connects
- `on_client_disconnected`: Client disconnects
- `on_message_publish`: Message published

`topic`: The topic that the message is published into, a string 

## Configure in Key-Value Format

### Enable Webhook

```bash
web.hook.enable = true
```

### Rule Syntax

The trigger rule's value is a JSON string, and the available Keys are:

- action: string, taking a fixed value
- topic: a string, indicating a topic filter, the operation topic can only trigger the forwarding of the event if it matches the topic

**Syntax**

```json
web.hook.rule.<Event>.<Number>=<Rule>
```

Note: You can configure multiple trigger rules for one event, and use `number` to differentiate the rules.

**Example**

For example, we only forward messages matching the topics of `a/b/c` and `foo/#` to the web server, and the configuration should be:

```json
web.hook.rule.message.publish.1 = {"action": "on_message_publish", "topic": "a/b/c"}
web.hook.rule.message.publish.2 = {"action": "on_message_publish", "topic": "foo/#"}
```

In this way, Webhook will only forward messages matching the topics of `a/b/c` and `foo/#`, such as `foo/bar`, etc., instead of forwarding `a/b/d` or `fo/bar`

### WebHook Trigger Events

The following events are currently supported:

| Name                | Description                  | **Execution timing**                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| client.connack      | Issue connection acknowledge | When the server is ready to send connack packet    |
| client.disconnected | disconnected                 | When the client connection layer is about to close |
| message.publish     | message published            | Before the server publishes (routes) the message   |

### Event Parameters

When the event is triggered, Webhook will group each event into an HTTP request and send it to the web server configured by url according to the configuration. The request format is:

```bash
URL: <url>      # From the url field in the configuration
Method: POST    # Fixed as POST method

Body: <JSON>    # Body is a JSON format string
```

The `body` for different events may differ. The following tables list the body parameters supported in each type of event:
