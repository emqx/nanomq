# Configure with Rule Engine

This section provides a comprehensive guide on setting up the rule engine according to your specific needs using a configuration file.

## Rule Engine Configuration

By default, the rule engine function is disabled. To enable it, please [compile with the `-DENABLE_RULE_ENGINE=ON` option](../installation/build-options.md). Once the rule engine is enabled, the `repub` function is supported by default.

## Republish Rule

Republish is a feature in NanoMQ that enables republishing of MQTT messages. The following parameters control its behavior:

Name                            | Type    | Description
------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------
rules.repub.rules[0].server      | String  | Rule engine option repub address (mqtt-tcp://host:port)
rules.repub.rules[0].topic       | String  | Rule engine option repub topic
rules.repub.rules[0].username    | String  | Rule engine option repub username
rules.repub.rules[0].password    | String  | Rule engine option repub password
rules.repub.rules[0].proto_ver   | Integer | Rule engine option repub protocol version, default is 4
rules.repub.rules[0].clientid    | String  | Rule engine option repub clientid
rules.repub.rules[0].keepalive   | Duration| Rule engine option repub keepalive
rules.repub.rules[0].clean_start | Boolean | Rule engine option repub clean_start flag, default is True 
rules.repub.rules[0].sql         | String  | Rule engine SQL clause 

### Create the Rule

Suppose you want to create a `repub` rule, upon receipt of a message from the `abc` topic, NanoMQ will encapsulate the `topic` and `payload` fields into a JSON structure and then forward this JSON-structured message to the `topic/repub1` topic. To implement this, the necessary configuration should be appended to the `/etc/nanomq.conf` file. The changes will take effect after NanoMQ restarts.

::: tab HOCON

Users wishing to use the HOCON configuration format can refer to the following structure and write their configurations into the `nanomq.conf` file. The relevant settings will take effect after NanoMQ is restarted.

- For a complete list of configuration options, refer to [Configuration Description - v019](../config-description/v019.md)
- For users of NanoMQ versions 0.14 ~ 0.18, please refer to [Configuration Description - v0.14](../config-description/v014.md)

```sh
rules.repub {
	rules = [
		{
			# # Repub address: host:port .
			# #
			# # Value: String
			# # Example: mqtt-tcp://127.0.0.1:1883
			server = "mqtt-tcp://localhost:1883"
			# # Repub topic .
			# #
			# # Value: String
			# # Example: topic/repub
			topic = "topic/repub1"
			# # Protocol version of the Repub.
			# #
			# # Value: Enum
			# # - 5: mqttv5
			# # - 4: mqttv311
			# # - 3: mqttv31
			proto_ver = 4
			# # The ClientId of a Repub client.
			# # Default random string.
			# #
			# # Value: String
			clientid = "repub_client1"
			# # Ping interval of a Repub client.
			# #
			# # Value: Duration
			# # Default: 60 seconds
			keepalive = 60s
			# # The Clean start flag of a Repub client.
			# #
			# # Value: boolean
			# # Default: true
			# #
			# # NOTE: Some IoT platforms require clean_start
			# #       must be set to 'true'
			clean_start = true
			# # The username for a Repub client.
			# #
			# # Value: String
			username = username
			# # The password for a Repub.
			# #
			# # Value: String
			password = passwd
			# # Rule engine option sql
			# # Rule engine sql clause.
			# # 
			# # Value: String
			sql =  "SELECT topic, payload FROM \"abc\""
		}
	]
}
```

::: tab KV format

Users wishing to use the KV configuration format can refer to the following structure and write their configurations into the `nanomq_old.conf` file. The relevant settings will take effect after NanoMQ is restarted.

- For a complete list of configuration options, refer to [Configuration Description - v013](../config-description/v013.md)

```bash
rule_option.repub=enable 
rule.repub.2.address=mqtt-tcp://localhost:1883
rule.repub.2.topic=topic/repub1
rule.repub.2.proto_ver=4
rule.repub.2.clientid=repub_client1
rule.repub.2.keepalive=60
rule.repub.2.clean_start=true
rule.repub.2.username=username
rule.repub.2.password=passwd
rule.event.publish.2.sql="SELECT topic, payload FROM "abc""
```

:::

::::

### Test the Rule

This section will use `nanomq_cli` to test the newly created rule.

1. Start `nanomq` in the first terminal window.

   ```sh
   $ nanomq start
   ```
2. Start `nanomq_cli` in the second terminal window, subscribe to the topic `topic/repub1` from the specified server address.
   ```sh
   $ nanomq_cli sub -t topic/repub1
   connect_cb: mqtt-tcp://127.0.0.1:1883 connect result: 0 
   topic/repub1: {"topic":"abc","payload":"aaa"}
   ```
3. Start a new `nanomq_cli` in the third terminal window, publish the message `aaa` to the topic `abc` with the following command:
   ```sh
   $ nanomq_cli pub -t abc -m aaa
   ```

You should see the message received in the second window from the topic `topic/repub1`.


## Data Persistence with SQLite

NanoMQ supports data persistence with SQLite, see below for the configuration items. 
To enable `SQLite`, please compile with the `-DNNG_ENABLE_SQLITE=ON` option. For detailed operation steps, see [Build from Source Code](../installation/build-options.md).

Name                         | Type   | Description
---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------
rules.sqlite.path             | String | Rule engine option SQLite3 database path, default is /tmp/rule_engine.db
rules.sqlite.rules[0].table   | String | Rule engine option SQLite3 database table name
rules.sqlite.rules[0].sql     | String | Rule engine SQL clause 

### Create the Rule

Suppose you want to create a data persistence rule with SQLite. When a message is received from the topic `abc`, the rule engine of NanoMQ will be triggered to store the contents of the `topic` and `payload` fields into a database table named `broker`. To implement this, the necessary configuration should be appended to the `/etc/nanomq.conf` file. The changes will take effect after NanoMQ restarts. 

:::: tabs type:card

::: tab HOCON

Users wishing to use the HOCON configuration format can refer to the following structure and write their configurations into the `nanomq.conf` file. The relevant settings will take effect after NanoMQ is restarted.

	path = "/tmp/sqlite_rule.db"
	rules = [
		{
			# # Rule engine option sql
			# # Rule engine sql clause.
			# # 
			# # Value: String
			sql = "SELECT topic, payload FROM \"abc\""
			# # Rule engine option SQLite3 database table name
			# # Rule engine db table name.
			# # 
			# # Value: String
			table = broker
		}
	]
}

### Test the Rule

1. Start `nanomq` in the first terminal window.

   ```sh
   $ nanomq start
   ```
2. Start `nanomq_cli` in the second terminal window, publish the message `aaa` to the topic `abc` in the second terminal window with the following command:

   ```sh
   $ nanomq_cli pub -t abc -m aaa
   ```
3. Then, in the second terminal window, view the messages saved in SQLite:

   ```sh
   $ sqlite3 /tmp/sqlite_rule.db
   SQLite version 3.11.0 2016-02-15 17:29:24
   Enter ".help" for usage hints.
   sqlite> .header on
   sqlite> .table
   broker
   sqlite> select * from broker1;
   RowId|Topic|Payload
   1|abc|aaa
   ```

**ðŸ“¢Note**: Make sure that `sqlite3` command is installed before using it. If it is not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```sh
apt update
apt install sqlite3
```

## Data Persistence with MySQL

NanoMQ supports data persistence with MySQL, see below for the configuration items. 
To enable `MySQL`, please install the dependencies first:

- ubuntu
```shell
apt-get install pkg-config
apt install libmysqlclient-dev
```
- macOS
```shell
brew install pkg-config
brew install mysql
```
### Configuration Item

To enable `MySQL`, please compile with the -DENABLE_MYSQL=ON option. For detailed operation steps, see [Build from Source Code](../installation/build-options.md).

Name                                | Type   | Description
