# NanoMQ

Nano MQTT Broker
A light-weight and Blazing-fast MQTT Broker for IoT Edge platform.
NanoMQ is base on NNG's asynchronous I/O threading model. With an extension of MQTT support in the protocol layer and reworked transport layer. Plus an enhanced asynchronous IO mechanism to maximize the throughout capacity.



## Features

1. Cost-effective on embedded platform.
2. Fully base on native POSIX. High Compatibility.
3. Pure C/C++ implementation. High portability.
4. Fully asynchronous I/O and multi-threading. 
5. Good support for SMP.
6. Low latency & High handling capacity.



## QuickStart

1. Compile & Install

To build NanoMQ, you will need a C99 & C++11 compatible compiler and [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) version 3.13 or newer.

Basically, you need to compile and install NanoMQ by following steps :

`$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq$ mkdir build & cd build`

`$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja ..` 

`$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ sudo ninja install`

Or you can compile it without ninja:

`$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq$ mkdir build ; cd build; cmake .. ; make`

2. Compile dependency

Please be aware that NanoMQ depends on nanolib & nng(nanonng for MQTT)

both dependencies can be compiled independently

`$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/nng/build$ cmake -G Ninja ..` 
`$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/nng/build$ ninja install`

compile nanolib independently:

`$PROJECT_PATH/nanolib/build$ cmake -G Ninja ..`
`$PROJECT_PATH/nanolib/build$ ninja install`




##  Configuration
NanoMQ provides several options for optimizing performance according to your system.



limiting the number of threads:

`$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DNNG_RESOLV_CONCURRENCY=1 -DNNG_NUM_TASKQ_THREADS=5 -DNNG_MAX_TASKQ_THREADS=5  ..`

For debugging, NanoMQ has a debugging system that logs all information from all threads. Which is aligned with Syslog standard.
And you can disable/enable it by:

```
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DNOLOG=1  ..
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DNOLOG=0  ..
```

Message queue support:

For macos, mqueue is not support, you can set -DMQ=0 to disable it. It is enabled by default.
```
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DMQ=1  ..
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DMQ=0  ..
```
System tunning parameters:
```
set max size of fixed header + variable header for MQTT packet , default is 64 bytes
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DNANO_PACKET_SIZE=set ..

set max fixed header size for MQTT packet, default is 5
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DNANO_HEADER_SIZE=set ..

set max property size for MQTT packet, default is 32
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DNANO_PROPERTY_SIZE=set ..

set queue length for QoS message, default is 64
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DNANO_QOS_LEN=set ..

set queue length for resending message, default is 64
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DNANO_MSQ_LEN=set ..

set nano qos timer, default is 30 seconds
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DDNANO_QOS_TIMER=set ..

set logical concurrency limitation by *-DPARALLEL*, default is 32
$PROJECT_PATH/nanomq/build$ cmake -G Ninja -DPARALLEL=32 ..
```
For more information about these parameters, please refer to the project's Wiki

## Usage

#Start MQTT Broker

`nanomq broker start 'tcp://localhost:1883' &`

Currently, NanoMQ only supports MQTT 3.1.1, partially supports MQTT 5.0

#test POSIX message Queue

`nanomq broker mq start/stop`
